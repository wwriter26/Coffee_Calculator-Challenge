# Coffee Calculator Website

## Introduction
Welcome to the Coffee Calculator website! This website is designed to help the coworkers at Bertram track and manage coffee purchases to know who should pay this day.

## Features
- **Coffee Carousel**: Navigate through a carousel to add new friends, see today's buyer, and add today's purchase.
- **Dynamic Updates**: The coffee buyer list updates in real-time, reflecting the latest coffee purchase contributions.
- **Responsive Design**: Enjoy a seamless experience across various devices, including mobile phones, Ipads, and desktops.
- **Console Output**: If you are curious to see the current array min-heap, just view the console.log() output to see the coworker array and their individual money spent. It can be viewed after submitting today's coffee price or adding a new friend.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Coffee Calculator website, follow these simple steps:

1. **Moving the Carousel**: Simply click on the edges of either of the back two slides to have them moved forward to the front. On mobile devices, you are going to have to click more on the bottom of the back slides.
2. **Add a New Friend**: Enter the friend's name and click the 'Add' button to include a new coworker into the coffee round.
3. **Today's Buyer**: The buyer's name is dynamically updated based on the coffee purchases.
4. **Add Today's Purchase**: Submit the cost for today's coffee to update the buyer list accordingly.

## How To Use

**1.** Open the html file in a browser like chrome or safari, the website should be fully functional and usable from there. 

## Assumptions

**1.** I assumed that every coworker would be present everyday so I did not implement a remove coworker option.
